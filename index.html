            <h1>Computer Vision Scientist at Tupel</h1>
            <p>Full-time August 2021 - August 2022; part-time December 2022 - present</p>
            <p>This was a Year In Industry (YINI) placement.</p>
            <p>I spent a year working on an implant scanner, which is a device used by dentists to help make prosthetic teeth. It accurately locates markers in the patient's mouth, and the dentist uses this information to design the prosthesis. It is much more affordable than its competitors, yet offers good accuracy. It is currently being tested in patients.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for writing python code for the computer vision methods, communication with a computer, and the UI. I collaborated on algorithm design, UI design, and on investigating ways to improve accuracy. I talked to dentists to establish requirements of the project, and acted on customer feedback.</p>
            <p>Computer vision requires good maths and problem solving skills. I also developed experimental skills to evaluate and improve the accuracy of the system.</p>
            <p>This was my first professional coding experience, and my first project that will have an impact, since it will save dentists money. Furthermore, I found collaborating with others and working on a large year-long project from start to finish immensely satisfying. I look forward to working on other challenging and impactful projects in the future.</p>
